# Sweave

This repository contains an example report of mine in Sweave, which served a similar purpose as Rmarkdown earlier, compiling R code chunks and latex comments simultaneously. 

The .pdf file is a report about the status of the software for discrete source classification of objects observed by the astrometric satellite Gaia, DSC, for which I was responsible between 2016-2018. The scripts for producing the analysis presented in the report can be found in file *validation1.R* (the input data and the R workspace image exceeds GitHub's limits on size, but are available from me upon request). The Sweave file, built on the workspace produced by *validation1.R*, is *DscValidationReport.rnw*, and the final pdf document is *DscValidationReport.pdf*.
